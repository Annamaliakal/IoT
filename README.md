When google assistant is asked to **open door** the value of variable *a* changes to **5** or **1**. And thus the servo motor turns 180 degrees.
When the switch is pressed the value of variable *a* changes to **0** and hence servo motor turns 180 degree in the direction opposite to that which was turned earlier.

Here servo motor is used in place for a door.
